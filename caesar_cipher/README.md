The Caesar Cipher from The Odin Project Curriculum.


I developed this as the first project from the Odin Project.

Notes:
I used a hash to assign the alphabet to a number so I could apply the cipher number to it.  

I also worked on sinatra code and the accompanying view for it to work in browser as a later project for the Odin Project.
