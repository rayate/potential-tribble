Hangman from the Odin Project Curriculum.

This is the README file for the Hangman app developed by Ray.

Notes:
hangman.rb was the second app I developed as part of Odin Project's Ruby Course.
More details to be updated later.

sinatra_hangman.rb and its accompanying view was developed as part of the Odin Project's Sinatra Course.
More details to be updated later.
